# What's been done and why should I care?
In previous Digital Humanities projects, I worked closely with this data. I made connections between religious populations of individual states and the outcome of court cases in those states. Though it did highlight some patterns, the database had more information hidden within the table's columns and rows. However, the rigidity of the database only allowed for a small amount of inquiry. If anything else was to be divulged, the database had to be more dynamic.

Jeffrey Ferro details extensive chronologies of Catholic Priests engaging in sexual misconduct in his book *Sexual Misconduct and the Clergy*. Though comprehensive, this work only lists priests that have been successfully outed as sexual deviants. It entirely ignores those that have been unsuccessfully accused of misconduct, which is an incredibly important factor to omit.

The goal of this is to make a database that can provide more useful information about this contentious issue. By creating a database that is not static, more information can be gleaned from the available data, and a better understanding can be had. Over the course of the semester, I was able to create a crude working database that allows for deeper inquiry using the information within the tables.

Looking at the long term, supplying the database with more information such as state population data, party affiliation of the state, and general poverty levels can provide more insight into the factors that can determine the outcome of the cases detailed.
