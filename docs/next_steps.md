# Next Steps

This database has an incredible amount of potential. For instance, if census data could be found for the previous century, a more accurate conclusion could be found regarding state religious population and number of cases that ended in a "Failure."

What would be interesting, too, would be to see how the levels of successes and failures change throughout the years, and to compare that to the changes in the portion of the United States population that identifies as secular.

The biggest challenge, though, would be to find that information and apply it to the existing data. If I was to expand on this project, I would try to create separate tables for the information on the priests, the locations, and individual orders.
